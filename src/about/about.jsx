          My name is Tobias Kallevik. Im a Computer Software Engineering student based in Grimstad, Norway. I have been interested in technology from a young age. This was the reason I wanted to become a computer engineer. Through my studies at UiA, I have gained a good introduction to topics such as object-oriented programming, programming for micro controllers, database technologies, web development, algorithms and data structures, data communication technologies, version control systems, and processes like Agile and Waterfall.
